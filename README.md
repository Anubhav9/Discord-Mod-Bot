# Discord-Mod-Bot
Implementation of Perspective API (from Google Cloud Platform) &amp; adding it to a Discord Server to check if it correctly classifies the result or not

# Introduction & Motivation

I never have been a fan of no-coding platforms. But Google I/O 2021 changed my perspective. I came to know there are a host of different APIs available on the Google Cloud Platform which can help you to train your Machine Learning Models without having explicit knowledge of the subject. Hence, I decided to try one which is known as the 'Perspective API'. Basically, it's a pre-trained sentiment-analysis model which we can directly use with the help of APIs. Therefore, I decided to make this discord bot and check how it's performing in real-time usage, and to my surprise, the results were absolutely great.

This project was motivated from Dale's Video on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABr_HkO0eGk&t=245s) (Making with ML Playlist), however, her implementation was a Javascript one, while, the one I made runs on Python. There are a few additional changes as well, however, they are nothing out of the blue.
